# youtube-summary-generator
A web app which generates the summary of any youtube video through its transcript by using its link as input.

Once the transcript is extracted using some ready library, it must be cleaned into a coherent script. 
This script can then be passed on to a LLM with a prompt wrapped around it to return the summary. 

Extra features could include (but not limited to):
<ul>
  <li>Language detection</li>
  <li>Presented in concise bullet points</li>
  <li>A question answer feature to answer questions based on the transcipt as the ground turth. </li>
</ul>
